# Spreadsheet-projects

This repository showcases Excel and Google Sheets projects focused on data cleaning, visualization, modeling, and analysis. It reflects intermediate and advanced skills in spreadsheet functions, formulas, pivot tables, lookup functions, conditional formatting, data validation, and Excel add-ins. The featured Excel workbooks, models, dashboards and visualizations exhibit core competencies in manipulating, analyzing, and extracting insights from data using Excel and Google Sheets.

Some projects are based on or draw inspiration from online Excel and Google Sheets tutorials and examples used as learning tools. However, recreating similar work was for practice only and does not imply copying. Beyond any referenced sources, the featured Excel workbooks, models, and visualizations represent my original work.
